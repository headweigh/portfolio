        <p>I'm Jen. I write for a living. I have written many things, some of which you can see here. I'm pretty good at writing down words and joining them into sentences to convey ideas and feelings. I'm not always good at explaining what I actually produce and why. <br /><br />Just ask my mom. After 16 years, she still has no idea what "things" I write. She knows it has something to do with technology and business and marketing. But her eyes go all swirly when I talk about it. <br /><br />Now that I think about it, I guess this portfolio is partly for my mom. And for anyone who would like to see what kind of "stuff" I do every day. Such as potential employers. </p>
